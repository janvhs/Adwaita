# Adwaita

**Adwaita** is a *high-level* library around **[GNOME's libadwaita](https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/libadwaita)** to provide a swifty development
experience for building GNOME apps.

Furthermore, it exposes **Libadwaita**, Adwaita's *low-level* counterpart, wrapping the C-API.

## Current Stage

Currently, this library is a **POC** and I would greatly appreciate input and contributions from the GNOME and Swift ecosystem.

## Motivation

Currently, there are five to six main languages in the GNOME ecosystem, C, JavaScript, Python, Rust, Vala and C++.

While most of them are easy and \[memory-\]safe languages, I can't find a language which fits my needs.
I want to use a modern, relatively popular, ergonomic and memory-safe language, which is statically typed
and ahead of time compiled. This eliminates C, JavaScript, C++ and Python.
While Rust and Vala might fit this criteria, Vala is not widely adopted outside of the GNOME ecosystem.
In my opinion, Rust is a great high level systems programming language, but it is hard to learn
and makes writing desktop-apps overly complicated.

## Goals

### Adwaita

- [ ] Handwritten **POC**
- [ ] Wrapping all libadwaita widgets
- [ ] A declarative API similar to Swift UI
  - [ ] Take inspiration from other projects
    - [ ] [OpenSwiftUI](https://github.com/Cosmo/OpenSwiftUI)
    - [ ] [Tokamak](https://github.com/TokamakUI/Tokamak)
    - [ ] [Relm4](https://relm4.org/)
    - [ ] [SwiftCrossUI](https://github.com/stackotter/swift-cross-ui)
- [ ] Reactive programming
  - [ ] No React-esque *"hook-rules"*
  - [ ] Take inspiration from other projects
    - [ ] [Blueprint](https://www.jwestman.net/2022/04/12/next-steps-for-blueprint.html#reactive-ui-programming)
    - [ ] [Grex](https://refi64.dev/posts/introducing-grex.html)
    - [ ] [OpenCombine](https://github.com/OpenCombine/OpenCombine)
    - [ ] [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift)
    - [ ] [Solid](https://github.com/solidjs/solid)
    - [ ] [Vue.js Reactivity](https://github.com/vuejs/core)
    - [ ] [Leptos](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos)
  - [ ] Thread safety?
    - [ ] Reactivity should work in multithreaded programs
  - [ ] Write tests

### Libadwaita

- [ ] Handwritten **POC**
- [ ] Autogenerated via GObject-introspection
  - [ ] Prior art done by [SwiftGTK](https://github.com/rhx/SwiftGtk/tree/gtk4)
  - [ ] [gtk-rs](https://gtk-rs.org/)
  - [ ] [gir Rust code generation](https://github.com/gtk-rs/gir)
  - [ ] [libadwaita-rs](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/Rust/libadwaita-rs)
- [ ] Only expose "*Swift-native*" types
- [ ] Automatic memory allocation and deallocation
- [ ] Handling of GTK-XML UI files
- [ ] Still feel mostly *swifty*
- [ ] Write tests

### General

- [ ] **Documentation**
  - [ ] Document the source, so other can follow.
- [ ] **Build an App**
- [ ] Upgrade to Swift 5.9 as soon as it becomes available on Fedora Arm64
  - [ ] Try to still support Swift 5.8
- [ ] Common commit message practices
  - [ ] Try to follow [Semantic Commit Messages](https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716)
  - [ ] Not every commit needs this, but try to explain what you're doing, so other can follow your thoughts.
- [ ] Follow best practices
- [ ] Decide on license. LGPL-2.1 (upstream) or MPL v2
  - [ ] Consider the *real work* is done by upstream GNOME
  - [ ] Adoptability
  - [ ] Fit in Swift ecosystem
  - [ ] Fit in GNOME ecosystem
  - [ ] "*Copyleft*"
  - [ ] "*Not infecting*"
  - [ ] Dual License???
- [ ] Easy contribution road
- [ ] Automatic linting and formatting
- [ ] Works easily with [Meson](https://meson.build)
- [ ] Template with Meson and Blueprint
- [ ] GNOME Builder integration
